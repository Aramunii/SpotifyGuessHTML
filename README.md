# SpotyGuess

**SpotyGuess** is an interactive music guessing game that challenges players to identify songs and/or artists by listening to just a few seconds of a track. The game integrates seamlessly with the Spotify API, allowing users to select music from a specific artist or playlist, or even use a custom playlist.

## How It Works
- **Search by Artist or Playlist:** Start by searching for an artist or playlist using the search bar, or choose to play with a custom playlist.
- **Choose Your Challenge:** Decide how many songs you want to guess—3, 5, 10, or keep going until you make a mistake in the "Até errar!" mode.
- **Game Modes:** 
  - **Padrão (Standard):** Listen to 1 second of a song. If you need more time, you can request additional seconds to be added incrementally.
  - **Contra o tempo (Against the Clock):** Listen to the song and try to guess the title or artist as quickly as possible. The faster you guess correctly, the better your score!

## Features
- **Spotify API Integration:** Leverage Spotify's extensive music library to search for artists and playlists or use your own playlists.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Choose between a fixed number of songs or play until you make a mistake, keeping the game flexible to your preference.
- **Two Modes:** The game offers a relaxed mode (Padrão) and a fast-paced, time-sensitive mode (Contra o tempo), catering to different playing styles.
